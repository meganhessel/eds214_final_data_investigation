#Exceed specs 
## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
Using roxygen to comment/document my function

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
Flowchart and text are pretty well explaining (maybe) the process - including what folders do which step 


# Collaboration 
1. I wrote multiple sentences for each spec in Henry's assessment. I gave him suggestions and even gave him examples from what I did (or what I've seen others do) to complete specs. I even got his function working!

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[E] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[E] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

[M] **The code is appropriately commented**

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

- `install.packages(c("here", "janitor", ...))` instead of `library` for installation not loading
- Megan fixed it during second round of instructor feedback

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[M] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
